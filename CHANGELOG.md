## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Pi community provider (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`).** First community provider under the Phase 2 registry (`builtIn: false`). One adapter exposes ~20 LLM backends (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Mistral, Cerebras, xAI, OpenRouter, Hugging Face, and more) via a `<pi-provider-id>/<model-id>` model format. Reads credentials from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (populated by running `pi /login` for OAuth subscriptions like Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus, GitHub Copilot) AND from env vars (env vars take priority per-request). Per-node workflow options supported: `effort`/`thinking` → Pi `thinkingLevel`; `allowed_tools`/`denied_tools` → filter Pi's 7 built-in coding tools; `skills` → resolved against `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills` (project + user-global); `systemPrompt`; codebase env vars; session resume via `sessionId` round-trip. Unsupported fields (MCP, hooks, structured output, cost limits, fallback model, sandbox) trigger an explicit dag-executor warning rather than silently dropping. Use in workflow YAML: `provider: pi` + `model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`. (#1270)
- **`registerCommunityProviders()` aggregator** in `@archon/providers`. Process entrypoints (CLI, server, config-loader) now call one function to register every bundled community provider. Adding a new community provider is a single-line edit to this aggregator rather than touching each entrypoint — makes the Phase 2 "community providers are a localized addition" promise real.
- **`contributing/adding-a-community-provider.md` guide** — contributor-facing walkthrough of the Phase 2 registry pattern using Pi as the reference implementation.

### Fixed

- **Server startup no longer marks actively-running workflows as failed.** The `failOrphanedRuns()` call has been removed from `packages/server/src/index.ts` to match the CLI precedent (`packages/cli/src/cli.ts:256-258`). Per the new CLAUDE.md principle "No Autonomous Lifecycle Mutation Across Process Boundaries", a stuck `running` row is now transitioned explicitly by the user: via the per-row Cancel/Abandon buttons on the dashboard workflow card, or `archon workflow abandon <run-id>` from the CLI. (`archon workflow cleanup` is a separate command that deletes OLD terminal runs for disk hygiene — it does not handle stuck `running` rows.) Closes #1216.

### Changed

- **Dashboard nav tab** now shows a numeric count of running workflows instead of a binary pulse dot. Reads from the existing `/api/dashboard/runs` `counts.running` field; same 10s polling interval.
- **Workflow run destructive actions** (Abandon, Cancel, Delete, Reject) now use a proper confirmation dialog matching the codebase-delete UX, replacing the browser's native `window.confirm()` popups. Each dialog includes context-appropriate copy describing what the action does to the run record.

- **Claude Code binary resolution** (breaking for compiled binary users): Archon no longer embeds the Claude Code SDK into compiled binaries. In compiled builds, you must install Claude Code separately (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` on macOS/Linux, `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex` on Windows, or `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) and point Archon at the executable via `CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` env var or `assistants.claude.claudeBinaryPath` in `.archon/config.yaml`. The Claude Agent SDK accepts either the native compiled binary (from the curl/PowerShell installer at `~/.local/bin/claude`) or a JS `cli.js` (from the npm install). Dev mode (`bun run`) is unaffected — the SDK resolves via `node_modules` as before. The Docker image ships Claude Code pre-installed with `CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` pre-set, so `docker run` still works out of the box. Resolves silent "Module not found /Users/runner/..." failures on macOS (#1210) and Windows (#1087).

### Added

- **`CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` environment variable** — highest-precedence override for the Claude Code SDK `cli.js` path (#1176)
- **`assistants.claude.claudeBinaryPath` config option** — durable config-file alternative to the env var (#1176)
- **Release-workflow Claude subprocess smoke test** — the release CI now installs Claude Code on the Linux runner and exercises the resolver + subprocess spawn, catching binary-resolution regressions before they ship

### Removed

- **`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/embed` import** — the Bun `with { type: 'file' }` asset-embedding path and its `$bunfs` extraction logic. The embed was a bundler-dependent optimization that failed silently when Bun couldn't produce a usable virtual FS path (#1210, #1087); it is replaced by explicit binary-path resolution.

### Fixed

- **Cross-clone worktree isolation**: prevent workflows in one local clone from silently adopting worktrees or DB state owned by another local clone of the same remote. Two clones sharing a remote previously resolved to the same `codebase_id`, causing the isolation resolver's DB-driven paths (`findReusable`, `findLinkedIssueEnv`, `tryBranchAdoption`) to return the other clone's environment. All adoption paths now verify the worktree's `.git` pointer matches the requesting clone and throw a classified error on mismatch. `archon-implement` prompt was also tightened to stop AI agents from adopting unrelated branches they see via `git branch`. Thanks to @halindrome for the three-issue root-cause mapping. (#1193, #1188, #1183, #1198, #1206)

## [0.3.6] - 2026-04-12

Web UI workflow experience improvements, CWD environment leak protection, and bug fixes.

### Added

- Workflow result card now shows status, duration, node count, and artifact links in chat (#1015)
- Loop iteration progress display in the workflow execution view (#1014)
- Artifact file paths in chat messages are now clickable (#1023)

### Changed

- CWD `.env` variables are now stripped from AI subprocess environments at the `@archon/paths` layer, replacing the old `SUBPROCESS_ENV_ALLOWLIST` approach. Prevents accidental credential leaks from target repo `.env` files (#1067, #1030, #1098, #1070)
- Update check cache TTL reduced from 24 hours to 1 hour

### Fixed

- Duplicate text and tool calls appearing in workflow execution view
- `workflow_step` SSE events not handled correctly, causing missing progress updates
- Nested interactive elements in workflow UI causing React warnings
- Workflow status messages not splitting correctly in WorkflowLogs
- Incorrect `remainingMessage` suppression in stream mode causing lost output
- Binary builds now use `BUNDLED_VERSION` for the app version instead of reading `package.json`

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-10

Fixes for `archon serve` process lifecycle and static file serving.

### Fixed

- **`archon serve` process exits immediately**: the CLI called `process.exit(0)` after `startServer()` returned, killing the server. Now blocks on SIGINT/SIGTERM so the server stays running (#1047)
- **Web dist path existence check**: server logs a warning at startup if the web dist directory is missing, instead of silently serving 404s
- **Favicon route**: added explicit `/favicon.png` route for the web UI

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-10

Binary env loading fix and release infrastructure improvements.

### Added

- **Docs site redesign**: logo, dark theme, feature cards, and enhanced CSS (#1022)

### Changed

- **Server env loading for binary support**: removed redundant CWD `.env` stripping — `SUBPROCESS_ENV_ALLOWLIST` and the env-leak gate already prevent target repo credentials from reaching AI subprocesses. Server now loads `~/.archon/.env` with `override: true` for all keys (not just `DATABASE_URL`), skips the `import.meta.dir` `.env` path in binary mode, and defaults `CLAUDE_USE_GLOBAL_AUTH=true` when no explicit credentials are set (#1045)
- **Workspace version sync**: all `packages/*/package.json` versions now sync from the root `package.json` during releases via `scripts/sync-versions.sh`

### Fixed

- **`archon serve` crash in compiled binaries**: the CWD env stripping + baked `import.meta.dir` path caused all credentials to be lost, triggering `no_ai_credentials` exit on every startup
- **CLI `version` command reading stale version**: dev mode now reads from the monorepo root `package.json` instead of the CLI package's own version field
- **Release CI web build**: fixed `bun --filter` syntax and added missing `remark-gfm` transitive dependencies for Bun hoisting

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-10

Binary distribution improvements, new workflow node type, and a batch of bug fixes.

### Added

- **`archon serve` command**: one-command way for compiled binary users to start the web UI server. Downloads a pre-built web UI tarball from GitHub releases on first run, verifies SHA-256 checksum, caches locally, then starts the full server (#1011)
- **Automatic update check**: binary users see a notification when a newer version is available on GitHub. Non-blocking, cached for 24 hours (#1039)
- **Script node type for DAG workflows**: `script:` nodes run inline TypeScript/Python or named scripts from `.archon/scripts/` via `bun` or `uv` runtimes. Supports `deps:` for dependency installation and `timeout:` in milliseconds (#999)
- **Codex native binary auto-resolution**: compiled builds now locate the Codex CLI binary automatically instead of requiring a manual `CODEX_CLI_PATH` override (#995, #1012)

### Fixed

- **Workflow reject ignores positional reason**: `archon workflow reject <id> <reason>` now correctly passes the reason argument to the rejection handler
- **Windows script path separators**: normalize backslashes to forward slashes in script node paths for cross-platform compatibility
- **PowerShell `Add-ToUserPath` corruption**: installer no longer corrupts `PATH` when only a single entry exists (#1000)
- **Validator `Promise.any` race condition**: script runtime checks no longer fail intermittently due to a `Promise.any` edge case (#1007, #1010)
- **Interactive-prd workflow bugs**: fixes to loop gate handling, variable substitution, and node ordering (#1001, #1002, #1003, #1005)
- **Community forge adapter exports**: added explicit export entries for Gitea and GitLab adapters so they resolve correctly in compiled builds (#1041)
- **Workflow graph view without codebase**: the web UI workflow graph now loads correctly even when no codebase is selected (#958)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-08

Critical hotfix: compiled binaries could not spawn Claude. Also fixes an env-leak gate false-positive for unregistered working directories.

### Fixed

- **Claude SDK spawn in compiled binaries**: the Claude Agent SDK was resolving its `cli.js` via `import.meta.url` of the bundled module, which `bun build --compile` freezes at build time to the build host's absolute `node_modules` path. Every binary shipped from CI carried a `/Users/runner/work/Archon/...` path that existed only on the GitHub Actions runner, and every `workflow run` hit `Module not found` after three retries. Now imports `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/embed` so `cli.js` is embedded into the binary's `$bunfs` and extracted to a real temp path at runtime (#990).
- **Env-leak gate false-positive for unregistered cwd**: pre-spawn scan now skips cwd paths that aren't registered as codebases instead of blocking the workflow (#991, #992).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-08

Patch release: SQLite migration fix for existing databases and release build pipeline fix.

### Fixed

- **SQLite migration for `allow_env_keys`**: add the missing `allow_env_keys` column to the `codebases` schema and a migration so databases created before v0.3.0 upgrade cleanly instead of erroring on first query (#988).
- **Release workflow binary builds**: wire `.github/workflows/release.yml` back to `scripts/build-binaries.sh` so tagged releases actually produce platform binaries and `checksums.txt` (#986, #987).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

Env-leak gate hardening, SSE reliability fixes, isolation cleanup smarter merge detection, build/version improvements, and deploy hardening.

### Added

- **Env-leak gate (target repo `.env` keys)**: scan auto-loaded `.env` filenames for 7 sensitive keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) and refuse to register or spawn into a codebase whose `.env` would silently re-inject keys into Claude/Codex subprocesses. Default is fail-closed (`allow_env_keys = false`). Includes a per-codebase consent column, registration gate, pre-spawn check in both Claude and Codex clients, and a 422 API error with web UI checkbox (#1036).
- **CLI `--allow-env-keys` flag** for `archon workflow run` — grant env-leak-gate consent during auto-registration without needing the Web UI. Audit-logged as `env_leak_consent_granted` with `actor: 'user-cli'` (#973, #983).
- **Global `allow_target_repo_keys` flag** in `~/.archon/config.yaml` — bypass the env-leak gate for all codebases on this machine. Per-repo `.archon/config.yaml` `allow_target_repo_keys: false` re-enables the gate for that repo. The server emits `env_leak_gate_disabled` once per process per source the first time `loadConfig` resolves the bypass as active (#973, #983).
- **`PATCH /api/codebases/:id`** endpoint to flip `allow_env_keys` on existing codebases without delete/re-add. Audit-logged at `warn` level on every grant and revoke, including a `scanStatus` field that distinguishes "scanned" from "scan failed" so audit reviewers can tell empty key lists apart (#973, #983).
- **Settings → Projects per-row toggle** to grant or revoke env-key consent retroactively, with an "env keys allowed" badge and inline error feedback if the PATCH fails (#973, #983).
- **Startup env-leak scan**: when `allow_target_repo_keys` is not set, the server emits one `startup_env_leak_gate_will_block` warn per registered codebase whose `.env` would block the next spawn. Skipped entirely when the global bypass is active (#973, #983).
- **Squash-merge and PR-merge detection** for `isolation cleanup --merged`. Unions three signals (ancestry via `git branch --merged`, patch equivalence via `git cherry`, and PR state via `gh`) to safely clean up worktrees whose branches were squash-merged. Adds `--include-closed` flag to also remove worktrees whose PRs were closed without merging (#1027).
- **Git commit hash in `archon version`** output. Read at runtime via `git rev-parse` in dev or from a build-time constant in compiled binaries; falls back to `unknown` (#1035).

### Changed

- **Env-leak gate error messages** are now context-aware: separate remediation copy for Web Add-Project, CLI auto-register, and pre-spawn-of-existing-codebase paths. Previously every error pointed at the Web UI checkbox even from the CLI (#973, #983).
- **SSE event buffer TTL** raised from 3s to 60s and capacity from 50 to 500 events, fixing dropped `tool_result` events during the 5s reconnect grace window that left tool cards perpetually spinning. Cleanup timer now resets on each new event so the buffer is held for TTL past the most recent event, not the first one. Buffer overflow and TTL expiration now log at `warn` level for observability (#1037).
- **Binary build detection** moved from runtime env sniffing (`import.meta.dir` / `process.execPath`) to a build-time `BUNDLED_IS_BINARY` constant in `@archon/paths`. Logger uses `pino-pretty` as a destination stream on the main thread instead of a worker-thread transport, eliminating the `require.resolve('pino-pretty')` lookup that crashed inside Bun's `$bunfs` virtual filesystem in compiled binaries. Same code path runs in dev and binaries — no environment detection (#982).
- **Cloud-init deployment script** hardened: dedicated `archon` user (docker group, no sudo) with SSH keys copied from the default cloud user, 2GB swapfile to prevent OOM during docker build on small VPSes, `ufw allow 443/tcp` and `443/udp` for HTTP/3 QUIC, fail-fast on network errors, and clearer setup-complete messaging (#981).

### Fixed

- **Env-leak gate worktree path lookup**: pre-spawn consent check now falls back to `findCodebaseByPathPrefix()` when the exact path lookup misses, so workflow runs in `.../worktrees/feature-branch` correctly inherit consent from the source codebase (#1036).
- **`EnvLeakError` FATAL classification** in the workflow executor now checks `error.name === 'EnvLeakError'` directly instead of pattern-matching the message, immune to message rewording (#1036).
- **Scanner unreadable-file handling**: distinguishes `ENOENT` (skip) from `EACCES` and other errors so unreadable `.env` files surface as findings instead of silently bypassing the gate (#1036).

### Security

- The default `allow_env_keys` per codebase is `false` (fail-closed). Codebases with sensitive keys in their auto-loaded `.env` files (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) are blocked at the next workflow run. **Remediation paths** (any one): (1) remove the key from `.env`, (2) rename to `.env.secrets`, (3) toggle "Allow env keys" in Settings → Projects, (4) `archon workflow run --allow-env-keys ...`, (5) set `allow_target_repo_keys: true` in `~/.archon/config.yaml`. See `docs/reference/security.md` for full details (#1036, #973, #983).
